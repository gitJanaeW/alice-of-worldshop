## Approach
I was hoping to use the Chimoney API but, in the interest of time, went with a simple API (https://fakestoreapi.com/docs). I first built out the UI statically to get a sense of what functionality would be need on-click, on-load and so on. Then from there, I went on to dynamically generate the pages required.

## Future Improvments
- Taking advantage of React's lazy loading functionality for performance
- limit the file size of images for performance
