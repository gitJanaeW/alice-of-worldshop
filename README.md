# Alice of WorldShop

## Purpose
Create a checkout experience that stores a user's cart in localStorage

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node

## Usage Instructions
- Clone the file
- Install dependencies with "npm i" in the root directory
- Install dependencies with "npm i" in the client directory

## Additional Features
- Product List/Card list page
- Cart, as outlined above

## Approach
I was hoping to use the Chimoney API but, in the interest of time, went with https://fakestoreapi.com/docs. I first built out the UI statically and then went on to dynamically generate the pages required.

## Future Improvments
<!-- - improving performance with Webpack -->
